My Name is Dominik Schiener, currently living in SÃ¼dtirol, Italy. These days I'm mostly working on personal research projects around Collective Intelligence and the Blockchain. This includes projects and research focused on Decentralized, Self-regulating Communities; [Decentralized Identity](http://composui.com); Blockchain-based Voting and eGovernance Solutions powered by the Blockchain/Smart Contracts.

I'm very interested in new P2P technologies that not only make our lives more efficient through trustless automation, but also more transparent. I very much believe that these technologies are the next step in eradicating barriers and making our World flatter and achieving one of the most important goals (at least for me): which is the **full empowerment of the individual**.

If you want to reach out to me, here is my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/domschiener), my [Github](https://github.com/domschiener) and my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/schiener) profile.

### Projects I created

* [PublicVotes](http://publicvotes.org): Ethereum-based voting platform that is fully transparent and enables voters to publicly verify the outcome of the vote. More than 3000 votes have been cast through the application since it went life

* [DecentralWiki](https://github.com/reposium-dco/decentralwiki): Very simple Proof of Concept of a Decentralized Wikipedia powered by [IPFS](https://ipfs.io)

* [Identity on Bitcoin](https://github.com/domschiener/identity-on-bitcoin): Simple Prototype of Identity on Wikipedia. It uses a fingerprint sensor and Raspberry Pi so that a user can register a new identity. The identity meta-information is stored on the Bitcoin Blockchain via an `OP_RETURN` transaction.
