My Name is Dominik Schiener, currently living in SÃ¼dtirol, Italy. These days I'm mostly working on personal research projects around Collective Intelligence and the Blockchain. This includes projects and research focused on Decentralized, Self-regulating Communities; [Decentralized Identity](http://composui.com); Blockchain-based Voting and eGovernance Solutions powered by the Blockchain/Smart Contracts.

I'm very interested in new P2P technologies that not only make our lives more efficient through trustless automation, but also more transparent. I very much believe that these technologies are the next step in eradicating barriers and making our World flatter and achieving one of the most important goals (at least for me): which is the **full empowerment of the individual**.

If you want to reach out to me, here is my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/domschiener), my [Github](https://github.com/domschiener) and my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/schiener) profile.

### Projects I created

* [PublicVotes](http://publicvotes.org): Ethereum-based voting platform that is fully transparent and enables voters to publicly verify the outcome of the vote. More than 3000 votes have been cast through the application since it went live.

* [DecentralWiki](https://github.com/reposium-dco/decentralwiki): Very simple Proof of Concept of a Decentralized Wikipedia powered by [IPFS](https://ipfs.io). It dynamically stores the summary of Wikipedia pages on IPFS by first extracting the information through the Wikimedia API.

* [Identity on Bitcoin](https://github.com/domschiener/identity-on-bitcoin): Simple Prototype of Identity on the Bitcoin Blockchain. It uses a fingerprint sensor and Raspberry Pi so that a user can register a new identity. With the characteristics of the fingerprint (stored as bitmap) we generate a `sha256` hash, which is the private key of the Bitcoin wallet. The identity meta-information is then hashed and stored on the Bitcoin Blockchain via an `OP_RETURN` transaction. The identity owner can easily access this in the future by scanning the finger again.
