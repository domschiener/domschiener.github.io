My Name is Dominik Schiener, residing in SÃ¼dtirol, Italy. I am currently running a Startup that is working on Social Tipping. I'm also involved in various projects and research, mainly focused on Decentralized Organizations and Decentralized Identity.

I'm very interested in new P2P technologies that not only make our lives more efficient through automation, but also more transparent. I very much believe that these technologies are the next step in eradicating barriers and making our World flatter. With this we can create a more balanced and fair environment where people have the same resources available to pursue personal goals. 

The identity project I'm involved in is called "Mosaic", and you can check out the basic concept and blog posts on the [website.](http://composui.com). If you want to reach out to me, here is my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/domschiener), my [Github](https://github.com/domschiener) and my [Linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/schiener) profile.
