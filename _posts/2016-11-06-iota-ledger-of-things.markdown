## IOTA: Ledger of Things

This is a presentation I usually give about IOTA, which is a revolutionary new distributed ledger specifically developed for the Internet of Things. I discuss the limitations of Blockchain, the benefits and features of IOTA, as well as our vision. We see IOTA as the backbone of the emerging Machine Economy, where any kind of resource and machine will be purchasable on-demand. If you are interested in joining or learning more about IOTA, please go to [IOTA Website](https://iotatoken.com)
